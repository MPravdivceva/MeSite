    <h1>Speech Emotion Recognition Project</h1>
    <p>
        This project focuses on recognizing emotions in speech using machine learning techniques.
        By leveraging datasets like CREMA-D and TESS, I aim to enhance human-computer interaction
        by enabling machines to understand human emotions more effectively.

        The model is trained to classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise
        based on vocal attributes. Stay tuned as I integrate the model into this website for live interaction!
